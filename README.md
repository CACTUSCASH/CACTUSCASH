Hi, I'm Saood Williams 👋 👋

I'm a cybersecurity student based in Cape Town, South Africa, currently exploring the fascinating world of offensive and defensive security. I enjoy building tools that help me understand how systems work—and how they can be protected. When I'm not studying packet captures or reading about the latest vulnerabilities, you'll find me writing Python scripts or tinkering with Linux.

## 🛠️ Projects

- **Port Scanner** – a simple TCP port scanner to enumerate open services on a network host. Great for practising socket programming and understanding network fundamentals.
- **Password Manager** – a minimal command-line password manager that demonstrates key derivation, encryption and secure storage concepts.
- **File Integrity Monitor** – generates and verifies SHA-256 checksums for directories to detect tampering or unexpected modifications.
- **Subdomain Enumerator** – enumerates subdomains of a given domain using DNS queries and customizable wordlists for reconnaissance.
- **Password Strength Checker** – evaluates the strength of passwords based on length and character variety.
- **Hash Cracker** – performs a dictionary attack on SHA‑256 hashes to demonstrate password cracking techniques.
- **Packet Sniffer** – captures and summarizes Ethernet frames using raw sockets, showing MAC/IP addresses, TTL and protocol information.
- - **Ping Sweep** – scans an IPv4 subnet using ICMP echo requests to identify live hosts.
- **Directory Bruteforcer** – brute forces directories on a web server using a wordlist and threads to discover hidden paths.

These projects are all available in my repositories and are designed to showcase fundamental cybersecurity techniques. Feel free to explore the code and suggest improvements!
